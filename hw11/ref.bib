abstract = {A clever idea is frequently necessarily the key to solve mathematics problems from Prasolov books. Modern mathematics, especially the theory of NP-completeness starting from the classical book of [1], also gradually moves forward similarly. Continuing the years-long tale of that theory, we add another result claiming the hardness of one more problem, namely Maximum triangle-free induced subgraph.}
