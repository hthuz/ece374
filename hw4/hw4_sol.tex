\question{10.A}\\
Let $F$ be the language $\{ba^{2n}\ \vline\ n \ge 0\}$. \\
Let $x$ and $y$ be arbitrary strings in $F$. \\
Then $x=ba^{2i}$ and $y=ba^{2j}$ for some non-negative integers $i\neq j$. Assume $j > i$. \\
Let $z=ba^{i}$. \\
Then $xz=ba^{2i}ba^{i} \in L$ as $ba^i$ is the string formed by odd characters of $ba^{2i}$ \\ 
And $yz = ba^{2j}ba^{i}\notin L$ as $i \neq j$ \\
Thus, $F$ is a fooling set for $L$. \\
Because $F$ is infinite, $L$ cannot be regular. \\


\question{10.B}\\
$\bullet$ \textbf{set:}\\
Let $L_0=\{0^k1^k \ \vline\ k \ge 0\}$, let $L=L_0 \cup$ \{bitstrings with number of 0s is twice that of 1s\}, L is not regular.\\
$\bullet$ \textbf{proof:}\\
Let $F$ be the language $\{0^n\ \vline\ n \ge 0\}$. \\
Let $x$ and $y$ be arbitrary strings in $F$. \\
Then $x=0^{i}$ and $y=0^{j}$ for some non-negative integers $i\neq j$ and $2i\neq j$. Assume $j > i$. \\
Let $z=1^{i}$. \\
Then $xz=0^{i}1^{i} \in L$. \\ 
And $yz = 0^{j}1^{i}\notin L$. \\
Thus, $F$ is a fooling set for $L$. \\
Because $F$ is infinite, $L$ cannot be regular. \\

\noindent
$\bullet$ \textbf{set:}\\
Let $L_1=\overline{L_0}$, the complement of $L_0$, let $L'=L_1 \cup$ \{bitstrings with number of 0s is twice that of 1s\}, L' is not regular.\\
$\bullet$ \textbf{proof:}\\
Let $F$ be the language $\{0^n\ \vline\ n \ge 0\}$. \\
Let $x$ and $y$ be arbitrary strings in $F$. \\
Then $x=0^{i}$ and $y=0^{j}$ for some non-negative integers $i\neq j$ and $2i\neq j$. Assume $j > i >1$. \\
Let $z=1^{i}$. \\
Then $xz=0^{i}1^{i} \notin L'$. \\ 
And $yz = 0^{j}1^{i}\in L'$. \\
Thus, $F$ is a fooling set for $L'$. \\
Because $F$ is infinite, $L'$ cannot be regular. \\

\noindent
$\bullet$ \textbf{counter-example:}\\
L and L' are not regular, $L \cup L' = (0+1)^* $ is regular.
However, $L \cap L' =$ \{bitstrings with number of 0s is twice that of 1s\} is non-regular.\\
$\bullet$ \textbf{proof:}\\
Let $F$ be the language $\{0^{2n}\ \vline\ n \ge 0\}$. \\
Let $x$ and $y$ be arbitrary strings in $F$. \\
Then $x=0^{2i}$ and $y=0^{2j}$ for some non-negative integers $i\neq j$. Assume $j > i$. \\
Let $z=1^{i}$. \\
Then $xz=0^{2i}1^{i} \in L \cap L'$. \\ 
And $yz = 0^{2j}1^{i}\notin L \cap L'$. \\
Thus, $F$ is a fooling set for $L \cap L'$. \\
Because $F$ is infinite, $L \cap L'$ cannot be regular. \\


\question{10.C}\\
According to the closure properties, if $L1$, $L2$ are regular then $L1 \cup L2$ is regular. If $L1$, $L2$ are regular then $L1 \cap L2$ is regular.\\
Because for all $i \ne j$, $L_i \backslash L_j$ is regular:\\\\
$\bullet$ Set $L_4 = (L_1 \backslash L_2) \cup (L_1 \backslash L_3)$ is regular.\\
$\bullet$ Set $L_5 = (L_2 \backslash L_1) \cup (L_2 \backslash L_3)$ is regular.\\
$\bullet$ Set $L_6 = (L_3 \backslash L_1) \cup (L_3 \backslash L_2)$ is regular.\\\\
Assume $(L_1 \cap L_2 \cap L_3)$ is regular.\\
Then $(L_1 \cap L_2 \cap L_3) \cup L_4 \cup L_5 \cup L_6= (L_1 \cup L_2 \cup L_3)  $ should be regular. \\
However, $(L_1 \cup L_2 \cup L_3)$ is not regular.\\
Thus, $(L_1 \cap L_2 \cap L_3)$ is not regular.

\question{11.A}

First, consider the special case where $i=0$. This language can be written as $L=\{b^j c^k d^l\ |\ j,k,l \geq 0$ and $j+l=k\}$. The follwing CFL represents this case: every character $b$ and $d$ is accompanyed by the occurence of $c$.
\begin{center}
  $S \rightarrow AB$
  \\$A \rightarrow bAc | \epsilon$
  \\$B \rightarrow cBd | \epsilon$
\end{center}

Then, consider another special case where $j=i$, which implies $k=l$. This language can be written as $L=\{a^j b^j c^k d^k | j,k \geq 0\}$. The CFL can be repersented as:
\begin{center}
  $S \rightarrow AB $
\\$A \rightarrow aAb | \epsilon$
\\$B \rightarrow cBd | \epsilon$
\end{center}

Assume the general case where $j \ge i$. The equation $j - i = k - l$ holds, which implies the additional number of $b$s compared to $a$s is equal to the additional number of $c$s compared to $d$s. Similar reasoning holds for the case where $j \le i$. From the above sepcial case, it's not difficult to get the follwing:
\begin{center}
  $S \rightarrow ABC | AC | aSd$
\\$A \rightarrow aAb | \epsilon$
\\$B \rightarrow bBc | \epsilon$
\\$C \rightarrow cCd | \epsilon$
\end{center}

Note that production rule $S\rightarrow ABC$ represents the case $j \ge i$ and $B\rightarrow bBc | \epsilon$ makes sure $j-i = k-l$ holds. Production rule $S\rightarrow AC|aSd$ represents the case $j \le i$ and $S\rightarrow aSd$ makes sure $i - j = l - k$ holds.

\question{11.B}\\
For $w \in L_B$, there's $\#_a(w) \ge \#_b(w)$. If $\#_a(w) = \#_b(w)$, it's obvious that it's already writen as one balanced string. \\
If $\#_a(w) > \#_b(w)$, then we can consider that the first character, which must be "a" since it is the prefix of w. \\
Set the $d(n) = \#_a(w) - \#_b(w)$ as the depth for the first n characters in w. Because $\#_a(w) \ge \#_b(w)$ for all prefix, $d(n) \ge 0$, d(1)=1.
Find all the n that d(n)=0, cut there. Then we can get $w=a \ \vline\ w_1 \ \vline\ w_2 \ \vline\ w_3 ...\ \vline\ w_n \ \vline\ a^*$ with the weekly balanced substring $w_s$. Seperate all the $a^*$ to be single so that it will meet the requirement.\\
In this case, $w$ can be represented by concatenation of substring $w_s$ with some characters $a$. So the property is proved.

\question{11.C}
\\According to the property concluded in Q11.B, consider two cases of substrings: consecutive $a$s and balnaced strings.
\begin{center}
  $S \rightarrow aS | Sa | abS |aSb | Sab | SS | \epsilon $
\end{center}
Production rule $S \rightarrow aS | Sa$ adds additional $a$ in the string, which represents $w_i = a$ in Q11.B. Production rule $S\rightarrow abS | aSb | Sab | SS$ represents strongly balanced strings, where number of $a$s is equal to the number of $b$s. Note that in all cases $a$ appears before $b$s.


\question{12.A}

The context free language for palindrome is easily derived as follows:
\begin{align}
  S_0 \rightarrow aS_0a\ \vline\ bS_0b\ \vline\ a\ \vline\ b\ \vline\ \epsilon
\end{align}

If we insert a character on former half of the palindrome, we can recover it back to palindrome by inserting the same character on the symmetric position on latter half of the palindrome or simply remove the newly inserted palindrome. This illustrates that insertion and deletion are equivalent. So only one operation needs to be considered.

Consider the case of $1$-close palindrome, which includes palindromes and strings that can be converted into palindromes with one operation. These langauges can be formed by introducing one unmatched pattern:
\begin{align}
  S_1 & \rightarrow aS_1a\ \vline\ bS_1b\ \vline\ bA_1\ \vline\ A_1b\  \vline\ aB_1\ \vline\ B_1a \\
  A_1 &\rightarrow aS_0a\ \vline\ bA_1b\ \vline\ a \\
  B_1 &\rightarrow bS_0b\ \vline\ aB_1a\ \vline\ b
\end{align}

Note that one $a\/b$ is inserted into a palindrome in former half or latter half. The product rule $A_1 \rightarrow a$ and $B_1 \rightarrow b$ takes even length strings into account. But if a $b$ is inserted, we should avoid the case of inserting another $b$ immediately, which is the reason why two non-terminals $A$,$B$ are used. Product rule $A_1 \rightarrow bA_1b$ is used instead of $A_1 \rightarrow bS_0b$ to avoid immediate follows of $b$, which may lead to symmetric pattern $bbbb$. The same reason holds for $B_1 \rightarrow aB_1a$.

Then, strings that is $1$-close to palindromes can be represented as  
$$
  S \rightarrow S_0 | S_1
$$

Languages that can be changed to palindromes with 2 operations can be formed by adding one layer to the former language. We don't add $A_2\rightarrow a$ and $B_2\rightarrow b$ here as it is already included in the $1$-close palindrome language:
\begin{align}
  S_2 & \rightarrow aS_2a\ \vline\ bS_2b\ \vline\ bA_2\ \vline\ A_2b\  \vline\ aB_2\ \vline\ B_2a \\
  A_2 &\rightarrow aS_1a\ \vline\ bA_2b \\
  B_2 &\rightarrow bS_1b\ \vline\ aB_2a
\end{align}
Do similarly for languages that can be changed to palindrome with 3 operations:
\begin{align}
  S_3 & \rightarrow aS_3a\ \vline\ bS_3b\ \vline\ bA_3\ \vline\ A_3b\  \vline\ aB_2\ \vline\ B_2a \\
  A_3 &\rightarrow aS_2a\ \vline\ bA_3b \\
  B_3 &\rightarrow bS_2b\ \vline\ aB_3a
\end{align}

The language that is 3-close to palindromes can thus be represented as
$$
  S \rightarrow S_0 | S_1 | S_2 | S_3
$$
where, all non-terminals and production rules are expressed in equations (1) - (10)



\question{12.B}

According to the theorem {\em Every context free language is equivalent to a grammer in Chomsky normal form}\cite{model}. Transform context free language $L$ into its Chomsky normal form. In Chomsky normal form each production rule is of the form $A\rightarrow BC \mbox{ or } A\rightarrow a$ besides those containing starting non-terminal $S$. In all cases, each single terminal symbol on the right of production rule represents a character of the langauge. If we add production rule $A\rightarrow \epsilon$ to every production rule of the form $A\rightarrow a$, the new context-free language represents subsequence($L$). So subsequence($L$) is also a context-free language.
